# 2 player m,n,k-game
This is relatively simple command line m,n,k-game implementation written in Java, created as part of a university course assignment. As the title states, the game is playable by 2 human opponents. Instructions on how to set up the game and play it are shown when running the program. The clearConsole method only works on Windows so, if you're running this on macOS or Linux, to avoid a crash, comment out it and any calls to it.

The main algorithm could be useful to someone who needs to check if a certain value repeats a certain number of consecutive times in a 2D array. IMHO, that's the only "clever" thing in this program.
